# NeonBadges

Give and Earn arbitrary merit badges to your friends on Twitter. 

Why? 

* It's cheaper and longer lasting than a greeting card.
* It's nice to recognize the people in your life who do nice things for you.
* It's potentially hilarious.
* It was my six year old's idea. He's awesome. 

It's a subjective outcome game. 

Definition of Subjective: 
> Based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.

Definition of Game:
> A form of play or sport, esp. a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.

The point is that it's fun to play. You get to show some sort of skill, the subjective part being how you feel about the skill, and the game part is that because it's subjective, you always win. It's not meant to be competitive, but a way to laugh with friends and start conversations.

With that in mind, here's ideas of good badges:

* A person showed up for user group meeting. 
* "I approve of this"
* You made a great baked good, the recipient liked it, give them a badge. 
* You gave or got help with code.

Here's some bad ideas for badges:

* A person did something X times. It's not a contest.
* "You're a tool". This is just kind of mean spirited, and accomplishes nothing.
* Badges for lack of doing something. 
* Badges for not being able to help with code.

So just keep in mind Goofus and Gallant from Highlights magazine. Do be a Gallant, don't be a goofus. 

### Where did the idea come from?

My son and I were watching Phineas and Ferb. Isabella, a recurring character, is a member of the Fireside Girls, an organization that has merit badges for everything. After a lot of conversation, it occured to us that people should give each other merit badges every day for our accomplishments. 

I immediately thought of the people at Neo who I could issue about 1000 merit badges to, then NeonBadges was born. 

### Why not OpenBadges?

The design principle is similar, but OpenBadges seemed too difficult to issue and claim to me. This, instead, doesn't require a login or account somewhere. You can issue a badge to anyone with a Twitter account. Badges should be as simple as possible to give and get. You don't want someone to whom you issue a badge to jump through a bunch of hoops. You might need to issue a badge for that. 

### Wat? There's nothing here. 

First off, a Wat is a Buddhist or Hindu monestary or temple like Angkor Wat. Secondly yes. Right now, it's mostly on paper after writing things down with my son. If you'd like to contribute, pair with me, ask about it, or just wait till all the specs are down. 

Or just fork, commit and pull request and we'll see.
